# Chirper

Chirper is the result of my first work with PHP. I followed a tutorial on the Laravel Bootcamp site, with [Blade](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation) rather than Livewire or Inertia. After that I improved on the notification system by allowing you to (un)subscribe to specific users.
